# 3d-pong

This is 3D pong made with a 3d graphics library I wrote called python_graphics_3d.

In order to run this script, you first need to install python_graphics_3d.

The game is a simple illustration of how to use the library. It is a scene composed of a sphere, a light, and several boxes making the paddles and table.

Underneath these graphical elements are some game objects that move the graphics around. After some simple collision checking, we have pong!
